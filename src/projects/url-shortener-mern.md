In this web app you can sign in, create custom short links, store them in your account and see the number of clicks on these short links. It is a MERN Stack project with Mongo Atlas, password hashing, React Hooks and Components, created thanks to a Youtube Tutorial.

Unfortunately I couldn't upload this project on my Linux server. This project works on both Windows and Linux. However on my Linux server I had errors with node modules that I couldn't fix. Maybe after I learn Docker, I will come back to this project and make it online.
